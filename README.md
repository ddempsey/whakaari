# Whakaari
Eruption forecast model for Whakaari (White Island, New Zealand). This model implements a time series feature engineering and classification workflow that issues eruption alerts based on real-time tremor data. This is the real-time version for running on a VM with html forecaster output and email alerting.

## Installation

Ensure you have Anaconda Python 3.7 installed. Then

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddempsey/whakaari
```

2. CD into the repo, switch to the transfer-learning branch and create a conda environment

```bash
cd whakaari

git checkout transfer-learning

conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate whakaari_env
```

3. Install keyrings.alt

```bash
pip install keyrings.alt
```

4. Set up Apache web-server and change permissions of html folder

```bash
sudo apt install apache2

sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html
```

then follow [these instructions](sudo apt install apache2 https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart). 

The installation has been tested on Windows, Mac and Unix operating systems. Total install with Anaconda Python should be less than 10 minutes.

## Setting up the controller
Open controller.py and under "__main__" make sure keyfile, mail_from, monitor_mail_to_file, alert_mail_to_file are appropriately set.

## Running the controller
Open a screen, activate the environment and then run the controller script
```bash
screen -S controller

cd scripts

conda activate whakaari_env

python controller.py
```

Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D to close the screen and then exit the VM.

## Disclaimers
1. This eruption forecast model is not guaranteed to predict every future eruption, it only increases the likelihood. In our paper, we discuss the conditions under which the forecast model is likely to perform poorly.

2. This eruption forecast model provides a probabilistic prediction of the future. During periods of higher risk, it issues an alert that an eruption is *more likely* to occur in the immediate future. At present, our best estimate is that when an alert is issued at 80% consensus there is a 1 in 12 chance of an eruption occurring. On average, alerts last about 5 days. Eruption probability and average alert length could change depending on which eruptions are used to train the model.

3. This software is not guaranteed to be free of bugs or errors. Most codes have a few errors and, provided these are minor, they will have only a marginal effect on accuracy and performance. That being said, if you discover a bug or error, please report this at [https://github.com/ddempsey/whakaari/issues](https://github.com/ddempsey/whakaari/issues).

4. This is not intended as an API for designing your own eruption forecast model. Nor is it designed to be especially user-friendly for Python/Machine Learning novices. Nevertheless, if you do want to adapt this model for another volcano, we encourage you to do that and are happy to answer queries about the best way forward. 

## Acknowledgments
This eruption model would not be possible without real-time seismic data streaming from Whakaari via GeoNet.
